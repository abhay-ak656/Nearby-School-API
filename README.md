# Nearby-School-API

This project is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that allows users to manage and retrieve school data based on geographical proximity. The API provides two main functionalities: adding a new school to a MySQL database and listing all nearby schools sorted by distance from the user's current location. Users can add a school by sending a POST request to /addSchool with details like the school's name, address, latitude, and longitude. To retrieve the list of schools sorted by proximity, users can send a GET request to /listSchools/:latitude/:longitude, where the latitude and longitude are provided as URL parameters. The distance between the user and each school is calculated using the Geolib library, and the list is returned in order of closeness. This project includes a Postman collection for testing both endpoints with example data and responses.
